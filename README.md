Description
"""
This project encompasses the following components:

A command interpreter: This tool is designed for data manipulation
  in a non-visual manner, resembling a shell,
   making it ideal for development and debugging purposes.

A website (the front-end):
This interface serves as the presentation layer,
displaying the final product to users,
combining both static and dynamic elements.

A data storage system:
Data, represented as objects,
is stored either in a database or in files.

An API: This component acts as a communication bridge
between the front end and the data,
facilitating operations such as retrieval,
creation, deletion, and updating of objects.

Regarding the command interpreter:
The command interpreter segment of this project empowers us to perform the
following actions:
Define your data model.
Effectively manage objects, including creation, updating, and deletion,
via a console or command interpreter.
Store and retain objects in a file, specifically in JSON format.
Initiate the command interpreter, simply execute the 'console.py' executable.
